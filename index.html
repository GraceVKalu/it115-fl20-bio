<p> My name is Uwaezu Victoria-Grace Kalu, but I go by Grace! 
  I am Nigerian but was born in South Africa then later moved to Seattle, Washington when I was about 4. 
  Currently I’m in the Software Development track program at Year Up Puget Sound. I became interested in 
  STEM through programs like ChickTech Seattle and MESA. 
  From there I joined another program last summer called Girls Who Code which combined both my loves 
  for business, and computer science. I plan on pursuing both as career! </p>
